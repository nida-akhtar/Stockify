# Stockify 📈

Stockify is a Python-based stock market analysis tool designed to fetch, process, and visualize financial data. This project demonstrates the use of data science libraries to track market trends and provide actionable insights through automated data pipelines.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-time Data Retrieval:** Fetches historical and current stock data using financial APIs.
* **Technical Analysis:** Implements key indicators to analyze market performance.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Uses Matplotlib/Seaborn to generate clear, insightful financial charts.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and structures raw financial data for accurate analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, yfinance (or your specific API)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / IPython

## 📂 Project Structure
* `StockFinal.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the data analysis pipeline, visualization logic, and model implementation.

## 📊 Sample Insights
*(Optional: If you have a specific screenshot of a graph from the notebook, you can add it here!)*

### Why this helps your application:
* **Keywords:** It uses terms like "Data Pipelines," "Preprocessing," and "Automation"—all things backend developers care about.
* **Readability:** Recruiters at Neurog can now understand what your code does in 10 seconds without having to scroll through 700+ lines of a `.ipynb` file.
* **Professionalism:** It shows you know how to document your work, which is a "Strong communication" trait they asked for in the job description.

**Would you like me to do a similar README for your FastAPI or VLM project to make your pinned section even stronger?**
